## For one-click result

```bash
python3 rar_bose_einstein.py rar_galaxies.txt
```

This runs the full analysis and prints:

- Residual statistics (mean, std, RMS) vs. the 2,693 SPARC data points
- Occupation number table across the full θ range
- The crossover prediction: θ = ln 2, g_bar/a₀ = (ln 2)² = 0.4805

Expected output (key lines):

```
Parsed 2693 data points
Mean residual:   -0.0036 dex
Std residual:    0.1329 dex
RMS residual:    0.1329 dex
RAR intrinsic scatter (McGaugh+2016): 0.13 dex
--> CONSISTENT: residuals within known RAR scatter
crossover_theta: 0.6931 (= ln 2)
crossover_g_over_a0: 0.4805 (= (ln 2)²)
n_BE_at_crossover: 1.0
```

Results are also saved to `bose_einstein_results.json` and `bose_einstein_plotdata.csv`.

## If you want the figures

**Figure 1** (the headline RAR comparison, three panels):

```bash
python3 make_rar_figure.py
```

Requires `bose_einstein_plotdata.csv` — run `rar_bose_einstein.py` first if not already present.

Outputs: `mond_be_rar_figure.pdf` and `mond_be_rar_figure.png`

---

## Dependencies

Python 3.8 or later. Install with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
```

No other dependencies or GPU required. This should run quickly on any modern laptop.

## Demonstrated by this repository:

The RAR interpolation function

    g_obs / g_bar = 1 / (1 - exp(-θ))     where θ = sqrt(g_bar / a₀)

is algebraically identical to a Bose–Einstein partition function:

    g_obs / g_bar = 1 + n_BE(θ)           where n_BE = 1 / (exp(θ) - 1)

The mass discrepancy at each radius is the Bose–Einstein occupation number
of a single bosonic mode. At the crossover θ = ln 2, n_BE = 1: the dark-sector
contribution equals the baryonic contribution.

The prediction has zero free parameters beyond a₀. Tested against 2,693
SPARC measurements across 153 galaxies, residual scatter = 0.133 dex,
equal to the known intrinsic RAR scatter (McGaugh et al. 2016).
